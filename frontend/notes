add run test option (some btn)
also there might be need to add some more websockets in case to be able to add only specific sets of rules to the specific assigments


add eyes when the person makes some big mistake


!If is's possible we should divide our webSocket API into smaller pieces -> the reacon of this is to enagle it to allow our users to only add allow rules/deny rules.
Couse of this user doesn't have to make any more changes it he want to put new element into result array.
Adictionally being able to add specific rules couses extra safety for our users same as the whole page security
